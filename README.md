## Building locally

To work locally with this project, you'll have to follow the steps below:

1. Fork, clone or download this project
1. [Install][] Hugo
1. Preview your project: `hugo server`
1. Add content
1. Generate the website: `hugo` (optional)

Read more at Hugo's [documentation][].

### Preview your site

If you clone or download this project to your local computer and run `hugo server`,
your site can be accessed under `localhost:1313/hugo/`.

The theme used is adapted from http://themes.gohugo.io/beautifulhugo/.

## Troubleshooting

1. CSS is missing! That means two things:

    Either that you have wrongly set up the CSS URL in your templates, or
    your static generator has a configuration option that needs to be explicitly
    set in order to serve static assets under a relative URL.
